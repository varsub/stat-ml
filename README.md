This repo contains all code and documents for my semester-long, individual statistical machine learning project. I applied several ML models to a large dataset on road accidents from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, aiming to characterize the top predictors of road fatalities.

I used the 10 statistical models below in this investigation. For each model, I took 10-Fold CV RMSE and R-squared values as indicators of model-strength.

Part I:
1. Linear Regression
2. Forward-Stepwise Selection
3. Backward-Stepwise Selection
4. Principal Components Regression (PCR)
5. Partial Least-Squares Estimation (PLS)
6. Ridge Regression
7. LASSO Regression

Part II:
1. Basic Classification Tree
2. Boosted Classification Tree
3. Random Forest Model

The R Markdown file `Final Project_Code_Varun Subramaniam.Rmd` contains all of the code, with comments, that I used to generate each of my ML models. The PDF `Final Project_Scientific Poster_Varun Subramaniam.pdf` is my final deliverable for this assignment: a scientific poster explaining the full process of my individual project. This poster contains hyperlinks to download the two CSV files used for this script under the "Data Description" section.
